# lamassu-machine
The software that runs the Lamassu Bitcoin Machine.

## Installing

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
git clone https://github.com/lamassu/lamassu-machine.git
cd lamassu-machine
npm install
./setup.sh
```

**Prerequisites**: You'll need Node.js and Ruby installed on your machine. There packages for these on most operating systems. You'll also need compiling tools. See here: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation.

### Mac OS X local install for testing and development

```
git clone https://github.com/lamassu/lamassu-machine.git
cd lamassu-machine

brew install nvm
# then following brew's install notes on nvm
nvm install 0.10
nvm use 0.10
rm -rf ./node_modules
# remove jpeg and manatee from package.json
# comment out in lib/brain.js around line 850: this._ensureRaqiaRegistration so that it goes to _idleTwoWay without requiring a raqia registration
npm install --no-optional
npm install mv

./setup

cp licenses.sample.json licenses.json

# in a separate window start a fake bill validator, and use the outputted ttys number on the next command, like /dev/ttys008
ruby fake_id003.rb

node bin/lamassu-machine --mockBTC 1KAkLnhU1BpvgjQUgLk1HF4PEgh4asFNS8 --mockBv /dev/ttys008 --mockTrader --mockCam --mockBillDispenser

open ui/start.html
```

To get a cursor comment out `body { cursor: none }` in ui/css/main.css

## Running

First, run the mock bill validator in a separate terminal window:

```
$ ruby fake_id003.rb
```

The mock validator will output its device path, e.g. ```/dev/ttys009```.
Use that to run the main program, called lamassu-machine, along with a Bitcoin
address **you control**:

```
node bin/lamassu-machine --mockBTC 1KAkLnhU1BpvgjQUgLk1HF4PEgh4asFNS8 \
--mockBv /dev/ttys009 --mockTrader --mockCam
```

This should output something like this:

```

```

Now, open a Chrome or Chromium browser to

```
file:///<lamassu-machine path>/ui/start.html
```

and you should get this:

![Start screen](docs/images/start-screen.png)

When the screen asks you to insert a bill, navigate to the terminal
where you opened the mock bill validator, and input **1**<kbd>Enter</kbd>
to insert a one dollar bill.

## Mocking

In order to easily test **lamassu-server**, you can use the ```mock``` command.
First, run lamassu-server in its own terminal:

```
LAMASSU_ENV=debug bin/lamassu-server --http
```

Now, in a separate terminal, run ```mock```:

```
node bin/mock.js -a 1KAkLnhU1BpvgjQUgLk1HF4PEgh4asFNS8
```

This will send $1 worth of bitcoins to 1KAkLnhU1BpvgjQUgLk1HF4PEgh4asFNS8, via lamassu-server.

Here's how to run it with a mock bill validator, a mock camera, currency forced to USD,
a mock bill dispenser, and using an HTTP connection to a local server. First, set
```brain.mockBTC``` to a bitcoin address in device_config.json. Then:

```
node bin/lamassu-machine --mockBv /dev/ttys009 --mockCam --fiat USD --mockBillDispenser --http
```
